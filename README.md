A bad name for a mediocre application.
```


## Disclaimer

This application does not use any kind of encryption for the traffic, i wouldn't recommend using this for machines across the internet at all.

## Point

The entire point of this application is to have a console application that is meant to enable simple messaging between computers.

### Why?

Because i was too lazy to search the exact same thing on google twice.

## How does this work?

This is entierly client to client based, no need for a "server" to connect two computers together. But that also means no "multi-computer" support.

I dont have any plans at this momemt to change this, but i might be enclined to add encryption and multi-computer support later.

### Configuration

The appsettings.json file contains all the config options for the application, there aren't any optional options yet.
